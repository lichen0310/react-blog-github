## ðŸš€ Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes
You can get a react-blog site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher

```

### 1. From your command line, clone and run react-blog-github:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/username/react-blog-github.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd react-blog-github

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

```

### 2. **Genrate a Github Personal Access Token.**

Genrate a Github personal access token using these [Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) `Make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token without any scope`

After that copy your genrated token and then encode your token into base 64 using this [Website](http://www.utilities-online.info/base64/)

`Copy your base64 converted token`


### 2. **Change `/src/config.js`.**
Go to your cloned repository and make the following changes in `/src/config.js`

```javascript
export const config = {

  // Your Github base64 Converted Token  
  githubConvertedToken: "Your Github converted token",

  // Your Github UserName
  githubUserName: "saadpasta",

  // Your Github Repo Name Where You Have your issues as Blog

  githubRepo: "react-blog-github"
};

```

### 3. **Write A Blog.**
After doing following changes now you just need to write a blog on repository issues that you have mentioned in your `config.js`

- Open your repository [github issues](https://github.com/saadpasta/react-blog-github/issues)
- Create a new issue 
- Now write your blog in github issue in markdown. You can also use [slack edit](https://stackedit.io/app#) to write your markdown
- Add a label `blog` on your github issue to make it different from other standard issues. Keep in mind `blog` label is mandatory otherwise it won't show on your website.

### 4. **Start Your React App.**
That's it now you just need to start your react application From your command line run . 

```bash
# Run
$ npm start

```
